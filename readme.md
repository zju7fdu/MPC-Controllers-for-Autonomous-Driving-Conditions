# ME-425 Model Predictive Control Mini-Project: Car Cruise Controller

![Car Model](figures/car_model.png) <!-- Add a relevant figure if available -->

## ðŸ“– Project Description
This project involves designing a Model Predictive Control (MPC) cruise controller for a car on a highway. The controller is developed in MATLAB and includes:
- **Linearized subsystem controllers** (longitudinal and lateral dynamics).
- **Offset-free tracking** to eliminate steady-state errors.
- **Robust Tube MPC** for adaptive cruise control with collision avoidance.
- **Nonlinear MPC** for full-state control and overtaking maneuvers.

The project is divided into six parts, covering system dynamics, linearization, constraint handling, disturbance rejection, robustness, and nonlinear optimization for overtaking.
